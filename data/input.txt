I can get you high, but I can't read your mind
I hate when you lie to me, still you keep me alive
Hands run down your spine, I wish you were mine
What's the perfect lie?
Words cannot describe this

Why would you cry? I don't know
I been getting high, now I'm ready to show
I been getting high, now I'm ready to go
Yeah I'm getting too high, I'm not too numb
Now don't stop, yeah I'm going to drop
Going too crazy isn't throwing the guap
Blowin' Mercedes and going to god
Going insane because I'm rollin' the rod
Now I don't wanna be the one to say it loud
Lately I been too fucked up
I've been getting faded in the club
I wanna be the one that you trust

I can get you high, but I can't read your mind
I hate when you lie to me, still you keep me alive
Hands run down your spine, I wish you were mine
What's the perfect lie?

I ain’t never gon’ answer it
I ain’t never gon’ pick up my phone girl

I’m all on my own, I’m all on my own
I know you ain’t high as this
Puttin' my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flyin' bitch
Breakin' my bones, you breakin' my bones
You want me to line my wrist
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me, 'cause it help me forget
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me 'cause I'm tryna get rich
I ain’t gon' put on a Tommy
If I don't got Tommy to put on my bitch
I’m doin' my thing
Now, bitch, I can sing, so don’t expect all my flows, I just switch
Step in this bitch, let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain’t smokin' on some, I'ma dip (Skrrt)

Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I’m growin' so tired of this (What)
How do you fight the feelin'?

B-B-Big Los on the track, boy

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She cannot keep your cool, and you let her (And you let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could, I could, I could, uh, uh

I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (Like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper with a leopard, playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Just straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I cannot get enough
So I’m strictly smokin' wax, 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gang, I need me a sad bitch
My life ain't lavish, I ain't never had shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you have it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my throne laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can't keep your cool, and you let her (And you let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could, I could, I could, I could

She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, ho
I cannot, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can do, for the public
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money people be makin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is mistaken
Was that money for the takin'? 'Cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then? Spend your life in the pen'?
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man? (Damn)

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
I ain't gon' like you never, I said
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can't keep your cool, and you let her (Let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper

Lemon Pepper
Twice the effort, under pressure
Twice the effort, under pressure

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me (I know that you don't)

Everyone hates me, but nobody knows me
Where did the time go, could somebody show me?
Get in the ride slow, you know where I'm going
Back of the club, girl, your feelings are showing
How can I not stare, the way that you're glowing?
I am a nightmare, you don't wanna know me
Running my fingers through your hair
Makes me remember everything, why don't you hate me?

I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here

I will be right here
I'll buy you a flight here

Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rearview
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down till there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies, and gems
You can have all of them

Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me

This is the life I made and I can't go back to fall

Fell in love once and I never been the same

Baby, I see passion in your eyes when you look at me
I'ma show you off like some Louis V
Coke lines on the mirror, snort that line for me

I just fell in love with a bad bitch

Feels like we're a world away
But we in the same room, be my girl today at least
She don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she know my pain, that's me
And she always let me be myself, she don't ever take bread
She don't need no help, that's real
While I'm busy tryna get my wealth
She ain't worry about a thing except my dick and my health, that's real

She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me
She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed

I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke
Everywhere I go, hoes wanna give me throat
I got mud, I got blow, I get lonely on my own
'Til my plug hit my phone and yo' bitch give me dome
Back to the drugs, pop a pill, fall in love
With a stripper in the club, I got demons in my mud
Red drop cups, baby, I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby, I don't give a fuck
Coke in her nose and my dick all in her butt
Red drop shawty, baby, I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby, I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby, I don't give a fuck, hell nah

Two blue pills and they both 30 millis
I be flippin' in the city if I got Bobby and Whitney
I got 2 for the 20, bet they know I get it in
I be flippin' on the 10 with my kin, fuck a friend
7.5. rollin' live 'cause they know that's Westside
In the north 'cross the track, where I ride, where I die
That's why I got it tatted on me, you can see it in my back
Yeah, 100 'til the death and you can hear it in my breath
I'll never ever bend and I'll never ever fold
Stay true, I was told, put a hunna on the stove
I'ma never switch up and I never ever change
My whole life I've been strugglin', I'll forever be the same

I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke

You know my pain and you know my life
You are the dark and you are the light
I steal the look when you're not with me
I wrote the book on feeling empty
Why did I ever take a chance on you?
I made you feel empty like the drugs that you do
You told me that you love me, that's not easy to do
But girl, don't tell me that you love me if you're just gonna leave
Don't tell me that you love me, it means nothing to me
No, no

Runnin' up that hill, you pushin' me back
Wish that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? 'Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like Zoloft
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passin' on and out
(And out, and out)

It wasn't somethin' that I thought about
But, knew that you were absolute in doubt

It wasn’t somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That’s how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn’t somethin' ‘til you brought it up
I knew that you were tryna make it out
Without a single scar, clawin' at my heart
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it’s not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbin' on top of me
Why you actin' like you fuckin' forgot me?
I’ve been dreamin' about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I’m movin' to Hollywood

Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
It wasn’t somethin' that I thought about
But, knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again

Shawty told me that she thought that I was 21
Now she want me even more 'cause I'm fuckin' young
Hatin' on me, 24, you a fuckin' bum

All these bitches fall in love, I'm the only one

I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna do you like that

Hold on to me

Hold on for me
Did you learn your lesson?

Lil Bo Peep in the same old jeans

Every time I spend a hundred she get somethin' for free

Let me bleed, watch me die
I got golden teeth, she got bright green eyes
She's my fantasy, she only comes at night
She don't know 'bout me, what goes on inside
I'll let you feel my pain if you would get me high
Had to make my name, I had to break my spine
Now I'm on my way, I'm just lookin' for pain
Bitches fuck me the same, it don't matter the place, okay

I just wanna die by my mama's side
Tell her that I love her while my brother cry
I don't got the time for no compromise

Yeah, I just wanna feel alive
Baby take your time
Smokin' on this loud (Woah)

Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie 'til the Sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my, nuts

Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die, I'ma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time, but I never wanna do that again
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waitin' for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free, all you gonna get from me
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all

Anybody tryna see me shine, man, that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind, you been on my line
That's the reason why I been workin' hard, you could stand aside

I could never die, I got too much pride
That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe
I can never die, I got too much pride
That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe

That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe
That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe

Every time I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

Knock, knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, ho
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, ho
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god
I been workin' like I never had a job

Every time I hit the dope I have a new dream

Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got nowhere left to go
You got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die
And there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burnin' down?
Or will you take your stand tonight?
Get your ass away from that light?
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby, drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave (Baby, I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream (Baby, I need you)
#
Ice in your veins, blood in your brain
I feel your pain, I think we're goin' insane
I saw you today and I thought I should say
That I still love you like I did back in 2008
Okay
Girl, I got whatever you want right here
I ain't never lettin' you leave, my dear
I'ma tie you up, and I'ma lock you away
You don't ever listen to the shit that I say
I'ma make you listen to me
I'ma make you listen to me
Smokin' on some loud
Out the motherfuckin' pound
I'ma give ya bitch an ounce for free
#
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You, you want the Moon?
Just say the word and I’ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down
Hey. That’s a pretty good idea
I’ll give you the Moon, Mary
<b>I'll take it</b>

Baby, I could give you the Moon
You know he can't do what I do, yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room, me and you
Baby, I could give you the Moon
You know he can't do what I do, yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room, me and you

I'ma keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wastin' my time
Givin' you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin', I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin' truck out (Skrr)
Tryna buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the Moon and bug the fuck out

Mary, I know what I’m going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that
I’m shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I’m going to see the world
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then I’m coming back here and I’ll go to college and see what they know and then I’m going to build things
I’m going to build air fields. I’m going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
I’m going to build bridges a mile long. Well, are you going to throw a rock?
Hey, that’s pretty good. What’d you wish, Mary?

Nah

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice (Yeah), nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (Tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (Fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (Wrong)
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (Hey, uh, hey)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy

Oh, I don't think I can take this anymore
No, washin' the blood from my wrist on the floor
Oh, fuck, what you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow (Shit)
Oh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
No, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Oh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep them felonies up in my coat
Up in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice (Yeah), nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (Tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (Fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (Wrong)

I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?
This lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go
Tell heaven "don't wait for me"
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way that she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait (Skrrt)

"I mean it been going on and building up for so many years that I was.. ya'know... suicidal, I mean I just didn't wanna live; so I just thought: 'If I'm gonna die, if I'm gonna kill myself, I should take some drugs', ya'know.. huh"

I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me (Say you love me)
Now you actin' like a ghost and that's okay, I know I'm ugly (I know I'm ugly)
Now I'm swervin' in the ghost and I'm okay, I'm gettin' money (I'm gettin' money)
Now I'm switchin' up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothin' (I stop for.. Skrrt)
Give me some time and give me your patience (Patience)
Came in the game last month, fuck the game, I'm done (I'm done)
Give me a sign and I'm gonna take it (Ahh)
Whatever way I want, bitch, I get paid up front (Clout, clout)
I'm gettin' mine, so fuck all your placements (Fuck)
Baby face, I'm young, fuck the place I'm from (Place I'm from)
Don't hit my line and say somethin' basic (Skrrt..rrrt)
If it ain't about the money, please don't waste no time (Waste no time)
Lookin' off the edge, and I'm picturin' the fall 'cause
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on (Hey)
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong, then I make another song

"May as well become a junkie because I felt like a junkie everyday, ya'know? Waking up starving, just forcing myself to eat, ya'know, barfing it back up.. it's like.. I'm in pain all the time."

No-one wants to kiss a girl in black

Worry 'bout yourself, baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feelin' like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was lookin' for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on an island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter
Got bang for ya butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shinin' through the shutter
Say she over me, whatever
'cause she underneath my cover (Ushio!)
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your ho
Bet you wish you got me mad
You don't, you won't, not never
Stop blowin' up my phone

Yo, run that shit back for me

Worry 'bout yourself, baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feelin' like it's five degrees tonight (Ushio!)
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was lookin' for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

I used to scream at you, nah (At you)
I used to turn my cheek at you (At you)
But now I need you too (You too)
And everybody give a fuck 'bout me
And I ain't nothin' to you
I'm just lookin' at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain, but I don't never complain
I'm insane, I'm deranged, I see your face in the rain
This ain't no race for the fame, but at this pace I'ma make it
Face it, you basic, Lil Peep your replacement
I'm takin' your spot
I'll give it back when I'm rakin' the guap
Maybe not
I keep on checkin' my statements
I'm checkin' for payments
While you checkin' ya plays, bitch (Plays, bitch)

I been doin' my own thing lately (Lately)
I been holdin' my own thing for safety (For safety)
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me (Till they pay me)
They askin' me how it feel, I say it's crazy (I say it's crazy)

When I'm comin' down, the light's real bright
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again? (Did I let you down again?)
If I leave here now, it won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breakin' down again (Breakin' down again)
But if I need to go just to show you
I don't fuckin' care if you don't give a shit 'bout me
At all, you little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
That I don't fuckin' stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you

You notice me
You notice me
You notice me
You notice me
You know it's me
You know it's me
You know it's me
You know it's me
It's me

My arms are searchin' for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you

Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I’m growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch? (Bitch)
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick (Quick)
I ain’t never gon’ answer it
I ain’t never gon’ pick up my phone girl

I’m all on my own, I’m all on my own
I know you ain’t high as this
Puttin' my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flyin' bitch
Breakin' my bones, you breakin' my bones
You want me to line my wrist
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me, 'cause it help me forget
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me 'cause I'm tryna get rich
I ain’t gon' put on a Tommy
If I don't got Tommy to put on my bitch
I’m doin' my thing
Now, bitch, I can sing, so don’t expect all my flows, I just switch
Step in this bitch, let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain’t smokin' on some, I'ma dip (Skrrt)

Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I’m growin' so tired of this (What)
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch? (Bitch)
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick
I ain’t never gon’ answer it
I ain’t never gon’ pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I love you
I won't pick up the phone
Just know that I need you

Layin' on my back now, lay another track down
Brought the black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, try not take a cap now
I'll bring the black cats out, now you fucked (Fuck)
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thraxx, read my tats from the backseat (Thraxx)
Why you throwin' shade like you finna phase me?
You a ho ass bitch, need a Maxi (Bitch)
Pad for your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's, but my raps free
Young bitch, I got plenty, on my bottle it say Remy
On my belt that shit say Fendi and the back green (Clean)

Got me talkin' 'bout my clothes girl (Clothes girl)
When I fall, won't you pick me up (Won't you pick me up)

When I call, she don't pick it up (Pick it up)
My head hurt from the drugs (Drugs)
It's somethin' in the bud, man, I need a new plug (New plug)
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb 'cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now, I could hold a map down
See me in the background, rolling up (Yeah, yeah)
I don't gotta rap loud, bitch, I got that trap sound
Hold on to my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rove'
Drivin' fast while she listenin' to Max B (What?)
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get yo' ass beat
One for the money, blow, two for the show
My flow go perfect with a sad beat (Sad beat)
Everywhere I go, all I ever see is snow
In the summertime, pussy make me happy (Make me happy)

'Cause, the world is so big, you feel me? And you like

Everybody that's holdin' it down, you know, uh

Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
With a face recognized
We can do anything
Worth remembering
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wannabe

Fuck the cops, man they on to me
Baby you were just a pawn to me
Fuck the cops, man they on to me

All the lights inside my room (My room)
Saw the fights that we sought through (Sought through)
Fool me twice, put the blame on you, yeah

What if I make you cry? (Cry)
What if I die?
What if I end my fuckin' life?

Alright, lemme go
SESH

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on? How I make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acapella
I could give you what you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me and see me smoke a 'milla (SESH)
Drunk kickin', dutch lickin', he said he can't fuck with me
Fuck this and fuck with me, I'ma take your luck with me
Bitch, what the fuck it do?
TeamSESH drippin' on the 1s and the 2s
Fuck your crew and fuck you too
Edge of the swamp, 'nother drug go through

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up

(Cowabunga, dude!)

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty, I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide
I'm comin' for you, your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind
A deadly war zone quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room
#
But I know I wanna take you, leave you alone, ayy
Hmmm, hello?

I don't really know where I'm tryna go but I know I wanna take you, yeah
When I'm on the road and I leave you alone I just pray I don't break you, yeah
I was on the phone waitin' in the other room not trying to wake you, yeah
When I'm on my own I'll be sipping Patròn
And I'll be trying to blame you, yeah

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

I would give it all back for you right now, I can never forget you
Run away from me, try to run away but I ain't gonna let you
And I can hear my heartbeat sounding like the bass drum
I said baby don't stall with the fucking and the make-ups, nah
I'ma take the long way home
Got a couple hundred missed calls in my phone

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

But when you tell me that you love me

I'm just going through some shit right now
And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

Lovin' you is like a fairytale
I  just can't pick up the phone again

One more time, I'm all alone again

Sex with you is like I'm dreamin', and
I  just wanna hear you scream again
Now  you're gone, I can't believe it
Time I spent with you deceivin' me
I  don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leavin' me

I still wonder why you tease me

Make a couple lines
'Cause you're making me high now

I could live life all on my own
Girl I'm only nineteen, but I'm already grown
All the shit I say to you I already told
To my last girl baby, but you're already grown

When I know that I'm not
Lookin' in the mirror, like I'm all that I got
You got me lookin' in the mirror, like you're all that I got
(I wanna hate you) Even though that ain't true
(I wish that I could take you) I'ma still stay faithful
I'ma take a photograph, rip it in half if I took it with you
Now I'm looking back at the past, I was trippin' when I tripped over you
She said, "What you wanna ask me?" (Ayy)
I don't listen to you
I see you looking when you past me (Ayy)
I wasn't looking for you (Yeah)
I got a bottle in my hand
Bad bitch-

I could live life all on my own
Girl I'm only nineteen, but I'm already grown
All the shit I say to you I already told
To my last girl baby, but you're already grown

If you not gon tell me your secrets

Yo, I think I'm insane like nobody else
When I was in pain, ain’t nobody helped
She left me to bleed, I was all by myself
She made me a promise she never would tell

I-I-I told her I needed her
I said I believe in her
Sh-Sh-She told me she never will
I hung up and I popped a pill
I ain't gon' hate you, my mama will
I-I-I ain’t gon' hurt you, my partner will
Remember you rode it like Chevrolet?
I know that my dick game is Bonneville
I know that I fuck you like no one can
I just saw your name in my phone again
I prolly am never gon' know yo man
Just call when you're over him
You-You-You prolly gon' never call
You-You-You prolly won't hear my song
You hate me, you never wrong
I just wish we could get along
Got me hatin' myself again (Huh?)
So eager to help a friend (Huh?)
That never would help me back (Nah)
I got coke on my shelf again
I just wanna make it right (Yeah)
But-But I can't miss my flight (Yeah)
Cop-Coppin’ the newest shit (Huh?)
Blinded by all the hype (Huh?)
Your outfit won’t change your life (Yeah)
This-This music might change my life (Yeah)
I'm fighting my demons now
Percocet every night
Walking ’round Hollywood
Take over, I prolly could
I'm smoking another ounce (Smoke)
'Cause Spitta and Roddy would (Smoke)
Back on my grimy shit
I'm swimming inside your bitch (Uh)
My motto is M.O.B. (Whoo)
That-That mean I was lying, bitch

Save a hunnit thousand lives with a hunnit thousand racks
Put it all on my back
Put it all on my back
Free the world from its stress

I got, I got weights on my shoulders and my bones finna snap
Save a hunnit thousand lives with a hunnit thousand racks, bitch

She told me it's real, I told her she fake
I know all the shit she won't say to my face
You wanna talk about me? Let's see how that works
You're fuckin' her now, I was fucking her first
You're staring at me, that's visible thirst
I'm onto you now, my penis is cursed
Ain't talkin' 'bout herpes, worse
How do these white bitches know how to twerk?
I ain't complaining, money is raining
All of my karma came in the payment
Fuck is you saying? My life is the best
God put me on earth to take all your stress
It's all on my back, I'm stronger than most
I'on smoke crack, I got coke on my coat
Smoke on a boat
Look at the ocean like damn it, one day they gon' call me the GOAT (Goose)

Got me fucked up in the car
Makes it easier to deal
I can't stand to see you bleed
When the reason for it's me

You're not who you say you are (You're not who you say you are)
Liar, what you claim to be? (Liar, why you claim to be?)
Leave the club and hold my hand (Leave the club and hold my hand)
We'll die off what we claim to need (We'll die off what we claim to need)

Call me "black Peep", I've been dying out west

Got me fucked up in the car

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Let it brew, make a move (Yeah)

Yeah make a move, it is true, I need you (I need you)
Take a trip, vibrant lights, catch a move
I need a piece of the vibe just to go to an island so I can take you
Picking my cup just to kill the cough that I just got from my diamonds, a flu (Is it you)
Is it you, is it me? (Is it me, is it me)
Hop in thе Ghost, so lets take a ride (Yеah)
Two hands up in the sky
And I cannot lose all my lucky charms
Think I'm riding the foreigns, from dawn to dawn
Bitch I'm a real don
Eating that pussy like cinnabon
I do not need this life (No)
I do not need it (No)
She's too conceded (Yeah)
I do not need it
I do not need this life (No)
I do not need it (Yeah)
Diamonds they jump in my eyes
I just can't see it

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have left in my heart
I've been through enough to know
When you're sad and we're far apart

Give me some time and I'ma make you mine again (Yeah)
Give me a line so I can write you a line again (Yeah)

VVS cuts on my wrist, I'm suicidal
Dancing all alone, I feel like Billy Idol
Looking in the mirror and I see my only rival
Only see my future at the end of this rifle
She was all I had 'til my shit went viral
Now these thoughts spinning in my head just like a vinyl
But now let's play back
Time to put my Mama in that Maybach
Almost started trapping but I had to take a safe track
Fucking with my boys we gon' have to push your faith back
Told me that you love me
Oh how sweet of you to say that
Fucked up one too many times
I'm man enough to say that
Told you that I love you
But baby I take that back

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

Ok until now before the girl with the
Broken smile, ask her if she wants
To stay around 'cause she will be loved
Poppin' pills so I can't feel it, can you feel me now?
Watching you just from a distance try and kill me now
I've been dealing with some issues tryna figure out
Is it worth it to keep going I need answers now
Ion love you too much, I love you 3 much
I'm poppin 4 pills I'm dying for real, I hope you save me
If you jump in we'll never make it to safety, I think it was
That broken smile that saved me

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

This world won't wait for you
I've lost all sense of time
Been sober a month or two
No drug will ever do

But my soul still craves a hunger
Like a wolf craves the taste of blood
As the world spins without permission
And the cranberry vampire howls at the moon up above

I think you straighten up a little bit
I think you should, I think you know
You should, you should look at yourself in the mirror sometimes
And say: "Look, what am I doing? Why, why am I this way?"

You ain't going nowhere, with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Ain't going nowhere, when I'm mad at you

Don't talk to me this time
Fuck me right here, baby, fuck it
One more night here, baby, then I'm gone
Everything you ever wanted from me
I could give it to you right now, ayy
Watch my hands move, baby it's me (it's me)
I'm about to knock your lights out, yeah
Bitch, it's cold in my own city
You were down with me, used to want the whole scene, hey
I admit I never hated it
We were just some stupid fucking kids, hated everything

Going nowhere, with that attitude

I eat pussy like some pepperoni Domino's
I eat booty at my grandpa funeral
Fuckin' bitches high on coke
I fuck fat hoes, I fuck short hoes, I'ma take that ho

Yeah, Pussy wet like a lake (Pussy wet like a lake)
Change them sheets everyday (Sheets everyday)
Bust a nut on her lips (Bust a nut on her lips)
Suck on some water, baby girl and then we can kiss (Then we can kiss)

Eat on that pussy, I bite it
Snorting the coke the whole night
Eatin' food the whole night
Might eat the booty like rice
Pussy leaking like a pipe
Beat it up like a fight
Pussy is loose, it used to be tight

Fuck that bitch, send that bitch to the hospital
Left your wife on the couch like a vegetable
Cocaine nostril, but you gotta suck the tip
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck the tip
She said, "I can't do it, impossible"
Dance to a pussy, I'm the man, you an officer
Bitch, you ain't confident but baby, I will suck your tits
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck my tip

Cocaine nostril, but you gotta suck the tip
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck the tip
Cocaine nostril, but you gotta suck the tip
Drugs if you wanna sip, drugs if you wanna sip

I eat pussy like some pepperoni Domino's

Rollin' 'round town in a big Z3
With a mouthful of Hennessy, video-game, bust the energy
She grippin' on Chanel with coke nails, I think I wanna take 'em
Make her eyes roll back, kinda like the Undertaker
No attachments, like a Call of Duty newcomer
Watch what happens, drippin' in ice, yeah, just like cool runnings
(Woo!) Head up out the window, bitch, who want it?
So many countries I'm passin'
Lookin' like Monopoly money, oh
Head up out the window, who want it?
You didn't want me back in college
Now you want me, but stop it, come touch me

Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop
Yeah, yeah
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop ('Til my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me 'til my heart stop

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot
Leave me when the time's right
Cocaine make her white lie
Lately I've been in my feelings listening to “white wine“
Sad souls with some cash flow
Never gave a fuck about the past (Oh)
Never gave a fuck about her past hoes, I'm past those

Ride 'til the wheels fall off and my heart stop
I can't feel my face but I won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop
Yeah, yeah
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop ('Til my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me 'til my heart stop (Yeah, ayy)

Nose to the grind not the white or the tan

Rollin' downtown to this shit
Shades sit low like the whip
Windows down, but they tinted
I want you to see where your bitch is
Speakers loud, creeping through your town, know you see me now
Leave the ground, fly off to LA with Peep, we shut it down
She throw it back just because of my name, it's crazy (Because of my name)
Feel like a kid but I'm dressed like a prince, lil baby (Okay)
With Smokeasac up in the rain and we're getting faded
A rare occasion if you see us next to strangers

Now she suckin' me, GB company
Fuck with me, she fuckin’ me
In that DoubleTree, fuck it, oh well
OxyContin, Xanax bars, Lortabs, and Percocet

Give me neck, smokin' cigarettes, free Biggavel
I just pulled up in that "Vroom-Vroom," kiss and tell (Skrrt!)
That's a all black Lambo’ (Bitch)

Fucking on yo' bitch, then I'm switchin' through the channels (Bitch)

These hoes eyeballing me, they say I’m rare and I’m handsome
I fucked a couple bitches and a pair in my mansion
I’m goth and I’m pale as fuck, they call me Marilyn Manson
They all want me to themselves, they can’t take me for ransom
I freed a couple months and tried to scare with these anthems
I cut too many off, I got my share with these randoms
I cut my phone off quick, don’t try to blare up my Samsung
I ate those bars so quick, could never flare up no tantrum

I feel your ghost in the wall
And it was way after dark
But don’t gеt scared, cause I’m by your side
I’m thе one that put you in the ground
Cover your grave in a place, can’t be found
Gotta make sure no one makes a sound (Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?
This lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go
Tell heaven "don't wait for me"
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way that she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait (Skrrt)

Lookin' in the mirror, like I'm all that I got
You got me lookin' in the mirror, like you're all that I got
(I wanna hate you) Even though that ain't true
(I wish that I could take you) I'ma still stay faithful
I'ma take a photograph, rip it in half if I took it with you
Now I'm looking back at the past, I was trippin' when I tripped over you
She said, "What you wanna ask me?" (Ayy)
I don't listen to you
I see you looking when you past me (Ayy)
I wasn't looking for you (Yeah)

I'm with Lil Tracy and we posted on the couch
We gon' hit the mall, take them goth hoes out
GothBoiClique make a goth ho shout
With the GothBoiClique every time I leave the house
I'm with Cold Hart and we rolling at the show
My teeth pink, Cold Hart chain gold
Black clothes, club lights, I don't even know
How I'm getting home, I'm just mobbin' with my bros

I was in the background, you was in the front
I was in the back of the club turnt up
Mackned strapped up, he don't give a fuck
Funny how my ex girls wanna make up
Lil Peep getting bucks, big bucks, big bucks
Wrists still cut from my last break up
Bitch still stuck on the goth boy love
Telling me it's nothing like a goth boy love

I'm with Lil Tracy and we posted on the couch
We gon' hit the mall, take them goth hoes out
GothBoiClique make a goth ho shout
With the GothBoiClique every time I leave the house
I'm with Cold Hart and we rolling at the show
My teeth pink, Cold Hart chain gold
Black clothes, club lights, I don't even know
How I'm getting home, I'm just mobbin' with my bros

You were in the background, I was in the front
Me and Lil Jeep pull up, Chevy truck (Got)
Got her in all black with some fishnets on
GothBoiClique can't leave you alone
Sitting in my room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger while she giving me neck
Baby, yeah I told you not to fall in love
'Cause baby there ain't nothing like goth boy love
Bitch

I'm with Lil Tracy and we posted on the couch
We gon' hit the mall, take them goth hoes out

I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her

I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you runnin' away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you running away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down

I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?

Jimmy V

Riding  in silence, V for violence
Smoking  on quiet‚ smoking like a violet
You smoking on a diet‚ I smoke‚ I get the highs
You smoking on a diet, while I get the high
Get  higher, and higher‚ and tower above the clouds
You  thought I was a spire, but I'm just a spider
And her pussy is so fire
I'm  hittin' and quittin', she callin' me sir
I'm hittin' and quittin'‚ she callin' me sir
She callin' me sir, so cool
You know what bird, I'm so cool
You  know what bird, you know
What I'm cooking just so sit and watch
Watch me stir, you watch me stir
Then I finna hit up the burbs and sitting on bricks
Watching slow mixing take your turn, not hittin' the curb
While I'm slumped is what you heard, but I just sit and slurp
And you know just-j-j-just, just watch-n-n-hing you
You know you prolly learn
Never had no exes, just just bitches deep to exit
And right before I exit, she on her knees I let her bless it
DM in a second (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't even read the message (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Watch the time go by (Damn)
All I wanna do is get high
Smoke blunts in my ride
Turn the music up, I like the vibes
I'm fine, you should worry about yourself every once in awhile
Cracking a smile while I cut myself (While I cut myself)
Sometimes it feels like nothing help
And that prescription take the pain away (Away)
I'm taking acid if it rain today
Watch the clouds while I waste away
Dripping out the sink
No one ever knows what I'm sipping out my drink (Out my drink)

Picking my cup just to kill the cough that I just got from my diamonds, a flu (Is it you)
Is it you, is it me? (Is it me, is it me)
Hop in the Ghost, so lets take a ride (Yeah)
Two hands up in the sky

I could be your nightmare, I could be your dream
I could be your fantasy, sometimes I could be mean
Sometimes I could be nice, sometimes I bring the rice
Sometimes I got my ice on, but baby not tonight
I just caught a fight, I just got off my flight
You should get a life boy, you should get your white
She just want the pipe, she know that I'm right
She don't wanna fight nah, I think I found my type, yeah

I do not need this life

She's too conceded

I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (Hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move

[?], yeah
Is it the time, yeah
Tropics feelin' right, yeah
I always feel so high, yeah
When we coming down? Yeah
When we coming down?
It just leaves my mind
I just need to come down
Yeah

Oh, oh
I'm on the edge, don't give up on me
I'm living good, so kiss me
Lil Tracy keeps calling me
...
Girl it's you that really gets me high
Girl, you know I'ma do the right
Me and you under moonrise

I make mistakes and I don't wanna lie
Bet she know that I'ma do it right
Codeine dreams every codeine night
This double cuppin' got me feeling right
...

She ain't looking for love tonight
I guess that I'm not the one tonight
But she know that I can do it right
Bet she know that I'ma do it right

You wouldn't even fuck me (What?)
I feel like everybody hates me (Yeah)
I'm alone and I'm bleedin' (And I'm bleedin')

[Instrumental]

She ain't looking for love tonight
I guess that I'm not the one tonight
But she know that I can do it right
Bet she know that I'ma do it right

Got me high on the floor for you
Baby, I wanted more for you
Now you got it, you can never leave
Black clothes in your darkest dreams
Ripped jeans in my fantasy
Looking through you, when you look at me
Now she geekin', she ain't never sleep
I've been geekin' for a couple weeks
I could really use your company
Cause everybody wanna fuck with me
Lately everybody wanna fuck with me
I'm on the edge, will you jump with me?

She ain't looking for love tonight
I guess that I'm not the one tonight
But she know that I can do it right
Bet she know that I'ma do it right

(?)

She ain't looking for love tonight
I guess that I'm not the one tonight
But she know that I can do it right
Bet she know that I'ma do it right

Bitch, I'm living my life (My life, yeah)

I took a pill and then a little of the white
Fuck around in the morning
Gon' have to take my flight back out to the motherfucking south
I've been talking so much, I made a million with my mouth (Ayy)
Plays every day on the highway
Nigga out here get it 'bout five ways
On Sunday to motherfucking Monday
Every Saturday, it just turn into a fun day
I'm counting, I'm counting and then I spend
I fuck around and I'ma turn around again
'Cause I picked a pack up and dip it back out, ayy, ayy, you know

I'm twisted, all night
I'm living my life
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night

Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
I'm living my life (Yeah, yeah)

I've been twisted all night
Wrists glisten, moonlight
You got me flexin', am I right?
She got me flexin', baby girl, am I right? Cut the lights on 'em
She been looking all night, lay the pipe on 'em
We be cooking all night, roll the dice on 'em
Poppin' molly, boy, I had to put the rice on 'em
She said "Baby girl, I prolly got some bites on 'em"

I'm twisted all night
I'm living my life
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night (All night)
Twisted all night (Kiss it, twist it)
Got me twisted (Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it)
Got me twisted all night
Bitch, I'm living my life (Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it)

Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it

Fighting the feeling
Tired of fighting the feeling, it's causing me pain
I play the villain, said I play the villain in your little game, ayy
She told me I'm killin'
She telling me I have been killin' the whole fucking game
I'm just a feeling, said I'm just a feeling they needed today, ayy
Fighting the feeling
Tired of fighting the feeling, it's causing me pain
I play the villain, said I play the villain in your little game, ayy
She told me I'm killin'
She telling me I have been killin' the whole fucking game
I'm just a feeling, said I'm just a feeling they needed today, ayy

I can make a light show
I said I can make the night glow easy
Tell me what you fight for
Tell me if I might seem greedy (Ay)
I can make a light show
I said I can make the night glow easy
Tell me what you fight for
Tell me if I might seem greedy (Ay)

I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
I said I can make the night glow easy (Easy)
Tell me what you fight for (Tell me what you fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy (Greedy)
I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
I said I can make the night glow easy (Easy)
Tell me what you fight for (Tell me what you fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy
I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
I said I can make the night glow easy (Easy)
Tell me what you fight for (Tell me what you fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy (Greedy)
I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
I said I can make the night glow easy (Easy)
Tell me what you fight for (Tell me what you fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy

You're causing me pain, you killed it
You're just a phase, you're just a fantasy
You just fulfil all I need today
You killed it

Call me on my phone, I don't pick it up
I ain't never home, I been fuckin' up
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck
Call me on my phone, I don't pick it up
I been on my own, baby I been fuckin' up
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck about anything

Ride 'til the wheels fall off and my heart stop
I can't feel my face but I won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop
Yeah, yeah
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop ('Til my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me 'til my heart stop

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot
Leave me when the time's right
Cocaine make her white lie
Lately I've been in my feelings listening to “white wine“
Sad souls with some cash flow
Never gave a fuck about the past (Oh)
Never gave a fuck about her past hoes, I'm past those

Ride 'til the wheels fall off and my heart stop
I can't feel my face but I won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop
Yeah, yeah
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me 'til my heart stop ('Til my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me 'til my heart stop (Yeah, ayy)
